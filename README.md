# RFM-Segmentation-Using-SQL
This project analyzes sales data to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, assigns RFM scores, and segments customers into groups (Champions, Loyal, At Risk, Lost, etc.), providing insights into spending, orders, and customer behavior.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- **Champions** spend the most (over 3.1M) with the highest average order value.  
- **Lost Customers** place many orders (73) but contribute less per order.  
- **Loyal Customers** maintain strong spending and consistent ordering.  
- **Needs Attention & At Risk** groups may require retention strategies.  
- **Promising & Potential Loyalists** show growth potential if nurtured.
